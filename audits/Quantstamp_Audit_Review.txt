This review clarifies the medium risk issue highlighted by Quantstamp regarding the Timelock contracts.

High impact functions require two transactions to execute:

1. Signal transaction
2. 24 hour delay
3. Finalize transaction

The signal transactions can be initiated by the admin of the Timelock.

If the admin signals a malicious transaction, during the 24 hour delay, the multi-sig of the Timelock can change the admin, which will prevent the malicious transaction from being finalized.

The Timelock contracts allow some configuration to be changed without a two step process, for example, setting of open interest caps and token weights.

This is to allow the platform to adapt quickly if needed, ideally the need for active adjustments should be minimized and the contracts have since been improved towards that goal.

The improved contracts automate most processes, isolate risks for LPs, provide better protection against price manipulation, allowing active adjustments to no longer be needed for things like weights and caps
